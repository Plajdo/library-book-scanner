## Hello traveler !

This project was developed by [Plasmoxy](https://github.com/Plasmoxy) and [Plajdo](https://github.com/Plajdo)

We are students on [Gymn√°zium Lipany](https://gymlipany.edupage.org/) school in east Slovak town called Lipany and we created this project to handle simple book management with integrated qr-code indentification.
